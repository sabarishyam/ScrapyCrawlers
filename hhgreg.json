Because the digital signal from the iPod/iPhone/iPad is transmitted directly to the AV receiver, there is no signal loss or interference, so you enjoy the best possible sound quality4K pass-through and upscaling supports latest high-resolution video formatsEco mode lowers power consumption by 20 percent (compared to power consumption when Eco mode is off)HDMI (6 input/1 output) with 3D and Audio Return Channel - 3D means the receiver can handle 3D signal data. The Audio Return Channel function enables data to be sent and received via the same HDMI cable, so you can hear the sound from the TV via a single HDMI cable, with no need for an extra optical cableTotal Purity Concept encompasses high drive amp technology, high purity pre-amplification, anti-vibration technology and independent pure power support. Designed with full emphasis on the highest possible sound qualityYPAO-R.S.C. (Reflected Sound Control) analyzes room acoustics and measures various speaker characteristics, then calibrates audio parameters to achieve optimum sound. It employs Reflected Sound Control to correct early reflections for studio-quality sound. It also provides DSP Effect Normalization, which varies the CINEMA DSP parameters according to the reflected soundsMHL\u00ae (Mobile High-Definition Link) support for high quality video and audio. MHL provides easy, direct connection of compatible mobile phones and this AV receiver. Playback of up to 1080p video and multi-channel audio from the phones is supported. The receiver also charges the connected phoneHigh-quality video processing with Edge Adaptive Deinterlacing - In ordinary deinterlacing, pixels in areas of movement are interpolated by upper and lower ranges. This causes jaggies in diagonal lines. Edge adaptive deinterlacing detects the direction of the line and interpolates the pixels optimallySCENE for one-touch start - Pressing a SCENE button powers on the AV receiver and selects the input source and DSP mode. You can reset the buttons for different sources by selecting a source and DSP mode, then pressing a SCENE button for more than three secondsHDMI CEC for easy operation. When the unit is connected to a CEC compatible TV, it will turn on and off together with the TV and you can use the TV remote to control the volumeIntelligent amp assign automatically assigns amplifier channels to certain speakers, depending on what functions are selected. For example, in a 7.1-channel system, when Zone 2 is off, all 7.1 channels will be used in the Main Zone. However, when Zone 2 is on, power to the two surround back channels will be directed to the two speakers in Zone 2 and the Main Zone will receive 5.1 channels of power. Similarly, when CINEMA DSP 3D is on, the two Front Presence speakers will be powered and not the two surround back speakers. When CINEMA DSP 3D is off, this situation is reversed. Thanks to Intelligent Amp Assign, there\u2019s no need to switch the speaker cables on the rear of the receiverNetwork functions - Provides a variety of network functions that enable you to access more sources and also enhance operation.
